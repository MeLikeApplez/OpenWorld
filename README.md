A JavaScript WebGL2 playground to experiment and play around with game dev topics such as water simulation and grass simulation. 

This is just a fun project to figure out how games work using WebGL2.

- [DistortionGL](https://github.com/MeLikeApplez/DistortionGL) is a JavaScript library for abstracting 3D concepts that already exist without having to reinvent the wheel.
- [Nvidia GPU Gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/contributors) is an awesome resource for how technical math and graphics programming were implemented.
